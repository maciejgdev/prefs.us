## A Short-Lived Disposable Settings API

Demo apps, mock ups, proofs of concept... Sometimes we just need a quick way to persist some data without getting into creating a dedicated data store. Or maybe we just don't want to pollute an existing storage with temporary data that is ephermal in nature and we only need for a short little while. Demos, mock ups, proof of concept, all are use cases for this service.

Well, say hello to prefs.us!
